Specific file, directory, and zip comparison tool

Yet another diff tool is what this project should be called.  I need something to help compare directories of Java applications, including version compiled it that wasn't available via other tools.

## Options
-f          Only work on files
-d          Only work on directories
-t <type>   Only work on files of type <type>
-n <name>   Only work on files that contain <name>
-llen       Maximum number of line characters to display,
            defaults to 120
-lnum       Maximum number of different lines to display,
            defaults to 10
<dir1>      Directory 1 to compare
<dir1>      Directory 2 to compare
